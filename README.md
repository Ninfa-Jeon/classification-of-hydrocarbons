# classification-of-hydrocarbons
A simple Java project based on simple Organic Chemistry.

## Working
The program prompts user to enter the chemical formula of an organic compound
and determines whether it is an alkane, alkene or alkyne.

Being found to be one of those, it gives the name of that compound (simple format)
and also displays a textual GUI for it (basic isomer).

If the formula doesn't match to the types mentioned, it tells the user what
functional group the entered compound belongs to (provided the input is valid).

P.S. the program works for as many as a 10-Carbon chain.
